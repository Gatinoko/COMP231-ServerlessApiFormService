# Serverless Form API Service
A simple API portal that lets you programatically create/consume **form items** and **business contacts**. This project was created as a software engineering exercise in order to improve my experience with full-stack development, as well as familiarizing myself with creation, implementation, and deployment of APIs on the web.
